# Bluetti2MQTT-srsgh42 fork

This is a fork of Bluetti2MQTT which hacks together a few fixes based on prior people's own fixes so that it works as of April 2025:

- Support for encryption (thanks @nhurman!) and newer devices (e.g. AC180)
- Tweaks to fix nhurman's version of bluetti_mqtt to support the last version of asyncio_mqtt which handles filtered_messages (14.0) and adds some pip dependencies (e.g. cryptography and specific supported versions of other stuff)
- Updated python images for this addon to fix build support in GitHub
- Overall this WORKS but is very hacky! I make no warranty/guarantee but I have successfully tested it on Raspberry Pi5 running HAOS. This entire add-on probably needs a rewrite to support all the various changes that have been made to its dependencies.
